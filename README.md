# Feed the Frontlines Georgia

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Feed the Frontlines Georgia, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting healthcare workers and local restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Founded in April 2020 by a group of University of Georgia graduates with aspirations in medicine, our mission rapidly expanded from a local initiative to a statewide effort.

## Our Mission

Feed the Frontlines Georgia was born out of a desire to support healthcare professionals working under unprecedented conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to aid local, family-owned restaurants struggling due to the lockdown. By fundraising and coordinating the delivery of fresh, healthy meals, we've been able to make a tangible difference in the lives of thousands.

## Impact

- **Raised Over $90,000**: Through fundraisers, grants, and grassroots fundraising efforts, we've been able to significantly impact our community.
- **Delivered 6,600 Meals**: Partnering with struggling local restaurants, we delivered thousands of fresh and healthy meals to hospitals across Georgia, focusing on underserved populations.
- **Wide Reach**: Our operations expanded to support healthcare professionals and homeless shelters in 21 cities, delivering meals to 30 hospitals across the state.
- **Community Engagement**: Led by an 83-member team, our efforts have brought together communities in a common cause, supporting both the frontline healthcare workers and the local economy.

## Team

Our team, including Aditya Sood, Anita Qualls, Nitish Sood, Taylor Stumpf, Jenny Zhang, and many more, represents a diverse group of volunteers committed to community service and support. The rapid growth from a four-person team to over 80 volunteers in just a few weeks exemplifies the community's eagerness to contribute to this cause.

## How It Works

Donations to Feed the Frontlines Georgia are fully dedicated to purchasing meals from local restaurants, which are then delivered to healthcare workers at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model ensures 100% of donations directly support our mission, with all contributions being tax-deductible.

We prioritize hospitals that are most affected by COVID-19, especially those in rural areas or with fewer resources. Our team works closely with hospital administrators and local restaurants to coordinate meal deliveries, ensuring that both healthcare workers are supported and local businesses are sustained.
