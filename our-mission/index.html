                <p>By donating to <strong>Feed the Frontlines GA</strong>, By donating to Feed the Frontlines GA, you are helping to purchase individually wrapped meals made by local restaurants and delivered directly to healthcare professionals. Medical personnel are working around the clock to fight for the lives of Georgia patients. <strong>Often, they do not have time during their busy shifts to eat a hot meal. </strong>Additionally, many hospitals have restricted or closed their cafeterias out of coronavirus-related concerns. Through your generosity, we can demonstrate our appreciation to healthcare providers who are tirelessly working to keep us safe while also keeping our favorite local restaurants in business. </p>
 
                <p>Now more than ever, it is crucial that we come together as a community to get through this unprecedented time. <strong>100% of the funds </strong>we receive will be used to purchase meals from local participating restaurants. We hope you will join us to support healthcare workers, hospitals, and restaurants across the state. Letâ€™s keep Georgia healthy and well fed. </p>
                     
                <p>Our goal is to deliver meals all across Georgia and particularly <strong>focus on regions and hospitals battling COVID-19 that most need support</strong>. We currently have teams working in Albany, Macon, Athens, Augusta, Savannah, Atlanta, and Valdosta. We hope to expand to Gainesville, Columbus, and Rome as we raise more donations. </p>
